Working in an asylum isn't so hard, thought Suzan. She was a hospital guard, patrolling at night to make sure no thieves came to steal drugs or stuff. Never was a major problem, probably never will. However, she had been called to another hospital specialized in the mentally ill. That is the good way to say it's an asylum for crazy people tied in padded cells. She had been called because they had finally captured a crazy woman that calls herself "the baroness". She came from an extremely rich family but she had completely lost her mind years ago, kidnapping women and transforming them into sex toys. Now that she is safely locked inside her own padded cell with her own straitjacket, new guards were hired because they feared someone would help the baroness escape. That was why Suzan was hired. 
Suzan knew how to guard a building, but she had no idea to how she should behave in front of an actual person. That was why when the baroness wanted to write a letter to her family and couldn't, that with the straitjacket and all, she helped her. Mostly by pity, really. The baroness dictated and Suzan wrote. It was just basic stuff, she was fine, the food was good, and she missed them. Nothing bad. So despite the rules, Suzan still posted the letter for her. What was the worst that could happen?

Two weeks had passed since the day she posted that letter. It was sunday, so half the guards weren't there. She was, because the pay is much higher if you stay on weekends. Anyways, here she was, patrolling the corridors when she sees that one of the many padded cell doors was wide open! Did someone escape?! No, it was cell 201, an empty cell. But why was it open? Bah, who cares, she'll just close it and lock it, so that no one could enter that cell and use it as a hideout. But suddenly someone grabbed her from behind and slammed a wet tissue on her mouth! Suzan struggled with all her might, but everything quickly became black.
The person who knocked her out was called Edward Johnson. He was one of the "employees" of the baroness, like some kind of bounty hunter. He had come thanks to the letter that Suzan herself wrote, because under the stamp was hidden a small message telling him to come with some very peculiar goods and that he needed to drug Suzan peculiarly and not just any other guard. He then bought off a guard and took his place to come inside the asylum, before finding poor Suzan and chloroforming her.
Once Suzan was out cold, Edward proceeded to drag her to an elevator, carefully avoiding detection, before bringing her to the baroness's cell. Using Suzan's keys, he opened the door and was greeted by the baroness with a warm smile.
"I thought you would never show up! Have you got all I asked for?", she asked.
"Of course madam.", he said, putting a large bag on the floor.
"Good. Get me out of this thing!", she said.
In less than a minute, the baroness was out of her straitjacket.
"Now, get everything ready for my departure. Come on, GO!". With that, Edward disappeared out of the doorway.
The baroness now looked at Suzan, still unconscious on the ground. With an evil smile, she opened the bag and started taking objects out of it.

Suzan finally woke up. Everything was still fuzzy around her and she had but little control over her own body. Why was she naked? She looked around, and the first thing she sees is the baroness, freed, pulling a jacket and a...can? out of a bag. Suzan tried to scream for help, but all she managed was a small whimper. That, however, got the baroness's attention.
"Well well well, look who finally wakes up. Good. You won't miss anything of the show that way.". With that, she opened the can and emptied all of its content inside the jacket. She was clearly putting a lot of effort into that, making sure not one inch wasn't drenched by the content of the can. Then, she turned towards Suzan. It was at that moment she realized that it wasn't just any jacket, it was a gray straitjacket! She tried to crawl away, but in vain as the baroness quickly was upon her and fitted her arms into the long sleeves of the bondage garment. In mere seconds the jacket was completely on her, and the zipper was closed behind her. Then came another can and a stream of liquid was poured on all its length.
Suzan was finally starting to gain her energy back, but it was already too late. The arm straps were tightened, crossing them under her breasts, followed by a distinct 'click' of a lock in her back.
"Hello my dear. You must think I'm crazy, drugging you before gluing and locking you in a special Kevlar-lined straitjacket. But I'm not. I am probably the most sane person in this whole world, because I love what is truly pretty, and always keep friends close to me. Now you were my only friend in this place, helping me send that letter that helped me escape. So I'll keep you close to me. However, you aren't really pretty, but don't worry. I'll make you pretty and will love you and keep you and love you and keep you and..."
At that point, Suzan had regained all her strength and when she heard what the baroness had in store for her, she started screaming and struggling in the jacket, but it was securely locked tight.
"HELP ME! SOMEONE HELMMMmmmhhhh...". Her screams were cut short as a cloth rag was jammed in her mouth, effectively silencing her.
"Now now, stop screaming. No one could hear you outside this cell anyway. So, as I was saying, I'll make you pretty."
With that, she took the can of glue and a sort of mask, then kneeled next to her, showing her what that mask was. It was a mask of her!
"Do you like that face? Isn't it the most prettiest face? Because this will be your new head from now on."
She then took a razor and shaved Suzan's head completely, before putting glue inside all the mask's interior. She then removed the gag and placed the mask on Suzan amidst her renewed protests and screams, then once it was on her, started fixing the little details with a tiny paintbrush and more glue, like fusing her lips to the lips of the mask, fitting her eyes into the eyeholes, and basically making sure the mask was seamlessly fused to Suzan's head. Once that was done, the gag came back on her new lips, then out came a wig that was also covered in glue and then applied on Suzan's new head. Finally, the baroness took a mirror and showed Suzan the results. She was speechless. She looked exactly like the baroness, up to every last tiny detail.
"So, what do you think of your new face? Aren't you soooo much prettier? Yes you are. And you will be, for ever! You see, my father made a fortune by making makeup. He created makeup that to this day cannot be removed, and created a makeup glue that could only be dissolved if the solvent was applied within two days. But then, he pushed that formula and created a glue that is totally permanent. Nothing can dissolve it! It got removed from the markets, because of accidents, but he kept a small factory that keeps on creating that glue in our house. So, you see, that face is your new face! No one can ever change it! And the same goes for that straitjacket! You look scared. Don't worry, it won't cut off your circulation, it was designed for permanent use. Anyway, it's kevlar-lined, so you couldn't uncross your arms without the key no matter how hard you try."
But now, it was the baroness's turn to change. She first dressed in Suzan's uniform, then took out a mask for herself and, with the help of the mirror, fitted it on her. Soon, she looked like a completely different person. Out came a red wig, and even Suzan could never have seen the change. Finally, she took out a phone from her pocket and she quickly called Edward telling him that they were done in the cell. Five minutes later, he was back at the cell, and both of them carried Suzan out of the cell.
"Are you sure we need to keep her?", asked Edward. "She could only slow us down."
"We are taking her and that's final. I want to keep her for myself. And everyone will think she helped me escape, so no one will be surprised when she goes missing."
After some discreet sneaking around, they managed to get to a window. Out the trio went, and into a van parked next to the asylum. They threw Suzan in the back and off they drove. It can't get any worse than this, thought Suzan.

Alas, it can, as she would soon discover.
The drive lasted until noon, when the sun was in the middle of the sky. There, the baroness took a bundle of cash from under the seat, gave it to Edward, then told him to leave the car. Once he was out, she started driving again, and that until sundown, without a single stop. There, she took Suzan out of the van, holding her closely, and that was when Suzan finally saw where they had arrived. They were in the middle of a huge forest, and in front of them stood a huge manor. It seemed abandoned, all its windows were broken and its roof was full of holes. And yet, the baroness took her inside the old house. The inside was no better than outside. The carpets, that in ages past must have been beautiful, were now no better than rags, and plants sprouted from every corner. She was carried into the old kitchen, and then dumped. She thought about running, but she had no idea where she was, was famished, and was stuck with the face of a wanted person. No, escaping would only result in her being imprisoned inside an asylum, or her death by dehydration. The baroness pressed a hidden switch, and a whole wall opened up! A hidden door! Then, she was once more picked up and carried in the newly opened passage. The new place she now was was completely different than the rest of the manor. The walls were metallic, everything was clean and everything was lit by electric lights. The baroness went down a passageway to a huge underground complex. There was even a living room with paintings on the walls.
"Welcome to my lair. I had it built here just for occasions like this one. The police will never search this place, and even if they do, finding the secret door would be impossible. And this will be your new home, my little me. You know, I always wanted to have a perfect sex slave. That was why you called me mad. But the others were just test subjects. People I could try new stuff on. And thanks to them, I know exactly what I want in my little slave. And who is mama's little slave? Yes it's you! Yes it is!". With that, she exploded in a maniacal laugh as she opened yet another door. Now Suzan was really struggling, but the baroness was way stronger than her, even without the straitjacket.
The new room they had entered was some kind of workshop with a big wooden table in the middle. In seconds, Suzan was strapped on the said table with her back up, legs spread wide apart. No matter how hard she tried, she could not move.
She could hear the baroness doing something behind her, but she could not see what it was. She started to cry again.
"What is it, slavetoy? Are you unhappy?". With that, she removed Suzan's gag.
"Please", said Suzan, "let me go."
"All right." Suzan could not believe what she heard. She was going to be released!?
"So,"continued the baroness, "to release you, I'll just have to put the key inside the keyhole, right?"
"Yes, please."
"Are you sure you would want that?"
"Yes."
"Fine. Your choice. But first, I'll put the gag back."
Like she said, the gag was once more applied.
"So look, here's the key. I'll just put it in the locks and you'll be free to go!"
But what she showed Suzan was how bad it could get. She showed her a pot with the key inside, but it was not solid anymore. The pot was filled with molten metal, and that was when she realized what the baroness meant by putting the key in the locks. She didn't want to open them, she wanted to weld them shut forever! When the baroness saw the look on her face, she started laughing again and began to pour the metal inside the locks, making sure not one drop fell next to the keyholes. Suzan was now trapped with another face and glued in a straitjacket that could not be cut, and now her arms had no chance to ever change position. While she waited for the metal to dry, the baroness started preparing something else that Suzan could not see.
A few minutes later, Suzan was unstrapped and turned on her back, before being strapped down once more.
"Now comes the time I really turn you into my little fucktoy. This might tingle a bit." As she said that, she took a tattoo gun, removed Suzan's prison pants and started getting to work on her inner thigh. She worked nonstop for probably a few hours. Once she was done, she went out and got Suzan food and water that she gulped down. Then she took took the tattoo gun again and started to work on Suzan's bare leg for a few more hours. Finally, she dabbed alcohol on both tattoos before unstrapping Suzan once more and carrying her out of the room. Suzan was in way too much pain to struggle at that point. The baroness finally arrived in front of a double set of doors covered in locks, opened it, and threw Suzan inside. It was a padded cell, exactly like inside the asylum!
"Now, little slut, welcome to your new and permanent home! I hope you like it, because you'll never get out of it again!"
And with a last maniacal laugh, she slammed the door shut. Then came the sound of the locks shutting, then finally nothing.
Suzan was finally able to look at what the baroness had tattooed on her. On her thigh stood the words 'RAPE ME!' with an arrow pointing towards her womanhood, while on her leg stood the word 'SLUT'. She began to cry. Not only did she lose her identity and her freedom permanently, she now bears tattoos showing her new status. She was a sex toy, here only for the pleasure of the baroness. Forever.
